          <p>People often ask me how I blew up on TikTok. Well, this is the story...</p>

          <p>
            Growing up, I loved performing card tricks to people. Seeing their astonished faces when they
            witnessed something so seemingly impossible become reality right before their own eyes gave me
            confidence.
          </p>

          <p>
            For context, English isn't my first language. When I first immigrated to Georgia from Taiwan, I was
            unsecure of my accent. Through performing magic tricks, I met a lot of people, which made me
            comfortable with public speaking.
          </p>

          <p>
            I created magic clubs in middle school and high school. During the weekly meetings, I taught
            members simple magic tricks. On weekends, other magicians from the club and I would perform at
            events in my community like nursing homes and local elementary schools.
          </p>

          <p>
            But then in 2020, Covid hit. I lost access to my audience, so I decided to showcase my passion online
            on TikTok. Without much thought, I started posting videos of my tricks 2 to 3 times a day. However,
            the news and engagement on my account were low. It went on like this for 3 months. I was impatient
            and frustrated because I hadn't achieved what I wanted. It was then, while scrolling on TikTok, I
            unexpectedly found a video by Gary Vaynerchuk. He had started out owning a wine business then
            later followed his love for influencing and motivational lectures. In his video, I remember so clearly
            him saying,
          </p>

          <p className="italic text-gray-700">
            "Passion is priceless and does not feel like work. Without hustle, talent will only get you so far."
          </p>

          <p>
            It hit me hard. I started researching algorithms and experimenting with different lengths of videos,
            formats, settings, and types of videos. In addition to magic tricks, I diversified my content. I started
            filming skits, comedy, POV videos, even Python and OOP tutorials. I continued to experiment with
            different video topics I enjoyed and that my audiences would enjoy as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            I never had expected my social media passion to turn out this great. I often reminded myself to not
            worry about the number of views, likes, or any harsh comments I would get. Instead of letting outside
            world's perspective negatively affect me, I made sure I was trusting my own intuition and feelings.
            After months of trials and errors, sending over 100 DMs to successful influencers, my social media
            presence started to shine. Within 3 years of consistent posting, I had gained <span className="font-semibold">1.6 million followers</span> on
            TikTok and received multiple sponsorships with companies and groups like Vineroo Watches,
            Team Wang, FaZe Clan & x-shot collab, and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've since stopped posting, which many of my friends often ask me why. Mental health was definitely
            a factor. A simple 15 second video online actually took hours of filming and editing. There are so
            many factors that come into play, and any small details can affect the outcome of a video. Filming had
            started to feel like a task, and I began losing the enjoyment and the satisfaction. In 2022, I had
            decided that it was time for me to move on from social media and try something else. I wanted to
            explore new hobbies that sparked the same energy I had for filming when I first started in August of
            2020. Since starting college, I found new passions like badminton and traveling.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am 21 years old and currently studying computer science at Georgia Tech. I did not grow up with
            much of a technical background, but I realized that Georgia Tech is the perfect place for me to
            strengthen my technical skills. That same hunger and drive I once had to grow on social media is now
            what I bring into my career path. Whether it's contributing to big tech, joining a startup, or even
            building one of my own, I want to keep pushing myself with that same determination to succeed.
